# Status Command

Show me:
1. Current RPI phase from `.claude/data/solo_rpi_state.json`
2. Most recent progress file from `thoughts/shared/progress/`
3. Current git branch and last 3 commits
4. Any TODOs in progress
5. Time since last state update

Then tell me:
- What I'm working on
- What phase I'm in
- What I should do next

This helps maintain cognitive alignment by making state visible.
